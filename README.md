## Our motivation
Our aim was to create a collective, user-friendly resource platform for women in India striving to upskill themselves in order to become financially and socially independent. 

## Target Group
Focusing primarily on middle-class, financially weak and women from orthodox households who have the access to the internet yet don't have the right knowledge to relevant opportunities, our initiative aims to embolden them.      

## What Naika has to offer?
Our dynamic web application offers a comprehensive platform of all relevant opportunities for women in all fields. We envisage to provide complete information regarding feasible courses available in their vicinity, based on honing their skills as well as awareness in general. To make it convenient to use for everyone, chatbot and language translation facilities have been provided.
We also wish to provide them relevant scholarships and financial aids provided by the government based on their eligibility.
